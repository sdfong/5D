					One of the main constraints of chopsticks is the physical hand dexterity that is required to hold them properly and pick up things without dropping them. They are less intuitive than forks or knives, where, as long as you simply grasp the handle, accomplish the task. There are not many material constraints. Early chopsticks were made of metal or stone, and in the 1800s, the Japanese introduced the first wood and bamboo chopsticks. This would then lead to usage of disposable chopsticks around the world. The only material constraint that chopsticks have is that they must be sturdy and solid. </p>

					<p> There are no environmental constraints, but there are some cultural constraints. At many asian restaurants (Chinese, Japanese, Korean, etc.) in the United States, tables are usually set with chopsticks. Where these cultures are very prominent, many people will already know how to use chopsticks, but in areas of the US or even in other countries with less east asian influence, there will be less people who have used chopsticks or know how to use them, regardless if they know what they are or not.
