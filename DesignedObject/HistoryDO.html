					Chopsticks were first used by the Chinese for cooking, since they afforded reaching into and stirring things in boiling pots. Chopsticks are the result of cultural and technological shifts in China. Chopsticks were used for cooking since around 1200 B.C., and emerged as eating utensils around A.D. 400. According to history.com, due to a population spike, people began cutting food smaller to decrease cooking time and energy usage. Smaller, bite-sized pieces made way for chopstick usage, and a decrease in the need for knives for eating. Confucius also influenced this movement of chopstick usage by spreading the belief that knives, a symbol of violence, should not be present when one sits down to enjoy a meal.
