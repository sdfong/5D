					The object affords being held and grasped. It affording moving or pushing small objects (such as with cooking), or picking up objects. These affordances are all visible, but it may not be natural to use chopsticks in the “correct” way the first time, rather than simply stabbing the object to pick it up. The thin, long form of chopsticks resemble many other stick-like objects that can be grasped and held by a human hand, such as pencils or knives. Without knowing what the object’s intended use, chopsticks afford many of the same things that a stick or rod would, but when offered or used in context, a person can realize more of their affordances.
