	<div id="textbox"> <p>My name is Stephanie Fong. Photography has always been one of my favorite hobbies, and I've grown a lot since I first picked up a camera seven years ago in middle school. I love potrait photography, and have found my friends to be the best and most *economical* models for my inspiration. I started with a Nikon DSLR, but eventually moved over to primarily film photography. Although its outdated and expensive and you can't see the photos right away, I've found that I'm more thoughtful when I can't click tens of hundreds photos at once and delete them at will. Taking more time to compose my photography through film has helped me improve as an artist. Landscape phtoography has not always been my forte, but I'm also working on that--I take my camera when I travel, and use these opportunities to take in my environment from a more thoughtfula nd observant perspective. Photography has made me more aware of my surroundings, and has helped me grow as person as well.  </p>
